<h1> ESTATE MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT TO DATE </h1>

<p> Since becoming fully operational, the Department has been carrying out teaching, research, consultancies and organizing seminars, conferences and workshops in the area of valuation, investment appraisal, portfolio management, land policy, real estate/development finance and has remained the main teaching and training unit for undergraduate and postgraduate students in these areas in the country. The curriculum of the programme has been revised on a number of occasions with the recent one done in January 2016, in order to enhance the effectiveness of the programme in meeting the realities of the modern day property market challenges at the local, national and global levels. </p>
